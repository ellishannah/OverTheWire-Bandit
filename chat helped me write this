Edit
cd ..
Use the following find command:

bash
Copy
Edit
find inhere/ -type f -size 1033c ! -executable
Found file: inhere/maybehere07/.file2.

Display the contents of the file:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat inhere/maybehere07/.file2
Password: HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG

Quick find Sheet:
find [directory] [criteria] [action]

Most useful flags:

type f → Look for files (not directories).

name "pattern" → Match files with a specific name (wildcards like *.txt work).

size 1033c → Find files of exact size in bytes (use c for bytes, k for kilobytes, M for megabytes).

readable → Find readable files.

! -executable → Exclude executable files.

exec COMMAND {} \; → Execute a command (e.g., cat) on the results.

LEVEL 6–7
Use the following find command to search for the file:

bash
Copy
Edit
find / -type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null
2>/dev/null discards error messages (e.g., permission denied).

Once the command runs without error messages, execute:

bash
Copy
Edit
find / -type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null -exec cat {} \;
-exec cat {} \; will display the contents of the found file.

This format should be easier for you to copy and paste directly into GitHub. It’s consistent throughout, follows standard Markdown formatting for headers, lists, and code blocks, and maintains all the steps you need. Let me know if you'd like further tweaks!
