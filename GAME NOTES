cat spaces(I used tab) which autocompleted command to "cat spaces/ in/ this/ filename" 
password: MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx
* Spaces in filenames: To handle spaces in filenames, use backslashes (\) to escape each space, or use quotes (" ").

LEVEL 5-6
ls 
cd inhere
uff, need a more effective way to search 
cd .. 
"find inhere/ -type f -size 1033c ! -executable" -> **inhere/maybehere07/.file2**
follow this path and open file

*Find quick-sheet 
  find [where_to_search] [criteria] [actions]
  Most useful flags:
          type f → Only look for files (not folders)
          name "pattern" → Match file names (wildcards like *.txt work)
          size 1033c → Exact size in bytes (c = bytes, k = kilobytes, M = megabytes)
          readable → File is readable
          ! -executable → File is not executable (! = NOT)
          exec COMMAND {} \; → Run a command (like cat) on the result


LEVEL 6-7 
"find / -type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null" 
once there is no crazy error messages run 
**"find / -type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null -exec cat {} \;"** 
*2>/dev/null = take away permission denied error messages 
          2> — redirect stderr (error output)
          /dev/null — a "black hole" that discards anything sent to it  
*-exec cat {} \; 
          exec — tells find to run a command on the results
          cat — the command to run (shows file contents)
          {} — gets replaced by the found file path
          \; — ends the command (escaped ; to avoid shell confusion)
