OverTheWire Bandit Challenges
Overview
OverTheWire Bandit is a game designed to teach basic Linux command-line and hacking skills. In this repository, you will find notes and instructions for each level of the game, along with solutions to the challenges. The goal of each level is to find the password for the next level by exploring the system and solving a series of problems using command-line tools and knowledge.

How to Use This Repository
This repository is organized by levels, where each level's notes contain the steps taken, commands used, and the solution found. Follow the instructions for each level and apply the commands you learn to the next stage of the challenge.

Folder Structure
game-notes.md: The detailed notes and solutions for each OverTheWire Bandit level.

cheat-sheets.md: A collection of useful commands, flags, and tips that can help with different challenges.

Progression
As you progress through the levels, you will SSH into a server, execute commands to gather information, and find passwords that allow you to move to the next level. The key challenge is to find and apply Linux tools effectively.

To help with progression, the following process is used:

SSH Login: Connect to the server using the SSH command provided in the level.

Explore: Use commands like ls, cat, find, and others to explore the server and locate files.

Apply Knowledge: Use the appropriate Linux tools and logic to solve problems and find the next password.

Exit: After completing a level, exit the SSH session and log into the next level using the found password.

Example Progression Steps:

Level 0-1: Use cat readme to find the first password.

Level 1-2: Use cat ./- to reveal the next password.

Cheat Sheet (Key Linux Commands)
ls: List directory contents.

cat: Display the contents of a file.

find [path] [criteria]: Search for files that match certain criteria (e.g., size, type, permissions).

cd [directory]: Change to a different directory.

exit: Exit the SSH session.

2>/dev/null: Redirect error messages (useful for ignoring "Permission Denied" errors).

Useful Flags for find Command:
-type f: Only look for files, not directories.

-size [size]: Search for files of a specific size (e.g., -size 33c for 33 bytes).

-user [username]: Search for files owned by a specific user.

-group [groupname]: Search for files belonging to a specific group.

-exec [command] {} \;: Execute a command on each file found (e.g., cat to display file contents).

Tips & Tricks
Navigating through directories: If ls does not show any results, try using ls -a to list hidden files.

Spaces in filenames: Use backslashes or quotes to handle spaces in filenames.

Finding specific files: Use the find command with proper flags to search for files with specific properties (e.g., owned by a certain user, specific file size).

Redirecting errors: Use 2>/dev/null to suppress "Permission Denied" errors.
